# Cloud-Based Modular Workflow for Individualized Bayesian Genomic Analysis: An Efficient Approach for Preprocessing and Association Study of Whole Genome Sequence 



## Overview
This repository contains the CWL code and related resources for a cloud-based, modular workflow designed to streamline the application of the Individualized Bayesian Inference (IBI) approach for genome-wide association studies using Whole Genome Sequencing data. Developed to enhance the accessibility and adoption of IBI among genomic researchers, this workflow emphasizes ease of use, efficiency, and reproducibility.

## Features
- **Modularity**: Easily interchangeable components suited for various genomic analyses.
- **Cloud Integration**: Optimized for cloud environments, ensuring scalability and cost-efficiency.
- **Reproducibility**: Well-defined processes using CWL and Docker to ensure consistent results across different computing environments.

## Directory Structure
- `/cwl`: CWL files for each component of the workflow.
- `/data`: Example data files and links to publicly accessible datasets.
- `/docs`: Documentation for the workflow, including setup and usage instructions.
- `/scripts`: Utility scripts to support data processing and analysis.

## Getting Started
To use this workflow:
1. Review the `/docs` for detailed installation and setup instructions.
2. Explore the `/cwl` directory to understand the available tools and workflows.
3. Test the workflow using data from the `/data` directory.
